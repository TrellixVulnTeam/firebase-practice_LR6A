#Firebase Practice

This is a practice project to learn Firebase functionalities. I am trying to build collaborative text editor.

Functions used:

1. Real time database to store simple text
2. Auth to authenticate user using gmail account
3. Google cloud functions using Node-mailer to send mail notifications


Note:

Collab text editor is under construction.
